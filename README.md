#####1.4 Description
Caption Wars is a mobile/web app where people vote for comical images, and the best made captions for those images. 


#####1.5 Vision Statement
Making the world a warmer place, one laugh at a time. 


#####1.6 Motivation
In a “Caption Wars” on a platform like reddit, there is generally no winner. We want to change that, but maintain its fun aspect. Expanding on the current Caption Wars, we can implement a voting system, and give points to users for making a post (similar to Yik Yak). Also, bringing this to a mobile platform could gather a lot of attention from the reddit community who would then essentially do free advertising. 


#####1.7 Risks
1. Having multiple platforms (web and mobile) could cause some errors where not everything is connected properly. 
2. Timeline for creating a web and mobile platform
3. Lack of data pertaining to the number of users on similar sites might cause an over-evaluation of our daily user number. 
4. The potential market may be too saturated with slightly similar ideas.


#####1.8 Risk Mitigation Plan
1. Ensuring that the platforms share the same database and doing research beforehand to figure out the best implementation will be a necessity. 
2. Focus on completing a working version on one platform before working on the other.
3. We must make sure to do a fair amount of marketing research on the popularity of sites similar to our product, and the average daily user numbers to provide a better estimate of how our design will perform in the marketplace. 
4. We will set our product apart through the user experience and additional features.


#####1.9 Version Control
To ensure version control on our product, we will use Git. 


#####2.0 Software Development Methodology
For our software methodology, we will use the iterative method, as we believe it to be the best fit for our team. In the iterative methodology, development starts with a smaller set of specifications for the software, as opposed to having every feature included initially. Once we have created the code for that smaller list of specifications, it is tested, and once successful, we repeat the process for the other additional features/fixes.


#####2.1 Collaboration Tools
Our primary two collaboration tools that will be used are Slack and Trello. Slack will be used predominantly for communication between members of the team, and Trello will be used to organize our project deadlines, and to make sure we stay up to date on the project milestones.
